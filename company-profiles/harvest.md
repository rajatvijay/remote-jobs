# Harvest

## Company blurb

We believe software should be useful, simple, and fast – so you can work better, get more accomplished, and make smarter decisions for your business.

Harvest was founded by Danny Wen and Shawn Liu in 2006, at a small office in downtown New York City. During the years leading up to launching Harvest, we ran a web design studio called Iridesco. As our business grew, we looked for tools to help us scale. We searched for a way to easily track time and invoice for our services. We wanted a well designed application that took user experience seriously. We wanted a service that innovated with technology. We couldn’t find one...

So we decided to invest our own time, energy and money into creating what we knew was a better way to run our business – and Harvest was born.
