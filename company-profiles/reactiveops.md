# ReactiveOps, Inc.

## Company blurb

At ReactiveOps, we do two things: DevOps consulting (AWS infrastructure automation, architecture, migrations to AWS) and ongoing retainer services called (unimaginatively) DevOps-as-a-Service (it's a terrible name, but what we got to work with right now.)

You can reach us at [https://www.reactiveops.com/](https://www.reactiveops.com/)

## Company size

About 10, and growing. Self-funded.

## Remote status

We're a remote ONLY company and are completely distributed throughout the US. We work from home, coworking facilities, the beach - wherever you can be happy, healthy, and productive.

## Region

US-only - we have many clients that require certain background checks to be performed, and certain work that can only be performed by US citizens (no clearance required).
