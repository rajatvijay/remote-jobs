## Remote status

Work from anywhere.
Bandzoogle is a "virtual office"; everyone works from where they love to be. We don't let physical distance keep us apart: we're always in close contact through our busy company chat rooms, meetings / screensharing via Skype, as well as yearly face-to-face meetups in fun places (last year was in at Chateau Montebello in Quebec).
Bandzoogle has been remote-only for 11 years, and we've made flexibility and work/life balance a priority. Our 21-member team are smart, friendly, pragmatic problem-solvers. Over the years, we've learned how to create a work environment where everyone can contribute and get things done, with minimal overhead.
