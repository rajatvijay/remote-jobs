We are a fully remote team, and have optimized our company from the start around remote work. Western North America is your office. We live in Slack. We rarely have meetings, but when we do it's over video (Zoom). Asana for PM, and github for the code stuffs, natch. We're fun and light-hearted, but serious about our craft.

We gather annually in the winter for an all company retreat somewhere fun (and warm).

Primarily front end: (HTML, CSS, JS), as well as Liquid. Some modest backend stuff, bring your favorite backend stack with you.
