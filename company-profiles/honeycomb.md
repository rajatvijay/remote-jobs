collaboration for brands, broadcasters and everyone in between.

## Company size

[~50 people work at Honeycomb.](https://honeycomb.tv/)

## Remote status

We are a remote first company with employees working from around Europe.
Tech team members that are based near London UK tend to go in once a week to
sync up, with the rest of the team joining via Google Hangouts or Screehero.

## Company technologies

We largely work with Ruby on Rails, though are using Ruby without Rails for
future services. We believe in experimentation and using the tool we think is
right for the job, so there is space for other languages too.

We also love Ansible, AWS/Azure, Git, Postgres, Redis, Github, Slack, and Trello.
