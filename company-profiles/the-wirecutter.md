# The Wirecutter

## Company blurb

Wirecutter is a list of the best gear and gadgets for people who want to save
the time and stress of figuring out what to buy. Whatever sort of thing you
need—tableware or TV or air purifier—we make shopping for it easy by telling
you the best one to get. The site was founded in September 2011 and was
acquired by The New York Times Company in October 2016.
