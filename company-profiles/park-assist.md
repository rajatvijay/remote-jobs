# Park Assist


## Company blurb

We donâ€™t have a formal blurb right now, so hereâ€™s something [I](http://aviflax.com/) posted when I was at
[Strange Loop](http://thestrangeloop.com/):

> Hi all! I started at Park Assist about 6 months ago, and Iâ€™m really happy â€” it's a small, profitable
> company growing at a healthy, sustainable pace, and solving real problems around the world. Among
> other benefits, our systems reduce CO2 emissions by eliminating driving around and around a busy
> garage looking for a free spot.
>
> Weâ€™re in ~130 garages around the world, and that number is growing fast, so although we're small in
> head count, we've got an outsized impact. And since our engineering team is only 10 people, and
> we're planning to at least double that over the next year, this is an opportunity for you to have a
> big impact on the culture, practices, processes, and values of this team. I'd be happy to tell you
> about all the changes I've been able to champion myself in my short tenure.
>
> If you're interested in designing, building, deploying, operating, and maintaining interesting
> systems that solve challenging and real problems, in a creative, supportive, collaborative,
> entrepreneurial environment, while working from anywhere in the Western Hemisphere, Europe, Africa,
> or the Middle East â€” let's chat!
