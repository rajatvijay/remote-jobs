# Ushahidi

## Company blurb

Ushahidi is a non-profit technology company that builds open source platforms to help citizens,
journalists, organizations, governments, and others gather, manage, analyze, and visualize
crowdsourced data. Our tools have been used by tens of thousands of individuals and
organizations fighting for social causes in over 159 countries — whether for monitoring
corruption in Zimbabwe, gathering real-time data on local poverty issues, or giving
people a voice in the Syrian crisis.

Ushahidi started as an ad-hoc group of Kenyan bloggers hammering out code in a couple
of days from various locations, trying to figure out a way to gather more and better
information about the 2008 post-election violence in Kenya.
