## Company blurb

At Customer.io, the mission is helping businesses talk like people. Today, we do this with an app that allows businesses with many users to send targeted, more relevant communication at scale.

## Company size

Weâ€™re a geo-distributed team of 27 across 8 different time zones!

## Remote status

We have an office in Portland, but folks based in Vancouver, Toronto, Kansas, DC, Colorado, Germany, France, Texas, Utah, Chicago, etc. Work from anywhere that allows you to do your best work; be it nomadically, at home, or at an office. We use the standard async tools to communicate (Slack, Basecamp, etc.) our work, but also make time to connect personally. We have "Serendipity", which is a Slackbot which pairs us up every two weeks and encourages us to schedule chats. We have unlimited vacation time, a healthy-living budget (as well as health care), and have you covered on professional growth.
