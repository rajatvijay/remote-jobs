We are open to members anywhere. *(We know the possible Mars One members will have problems with real-time communication but we are planning a tachyon beam or a wormhole bridge.)* Talking seriously, There are legal issues for associating people living outside Brazil, but that is a problem that we will be happy to solve when needed. Besides that we must consider language limitations on the role you will play at Colivre. Our primary language is Portuguese.
