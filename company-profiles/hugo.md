# Hugo

## Company blurb

Hugo has two beautiful products (built in house):
-Quriobot (https://quriobot.com): our latest product which offers you a chatbot without any hassle and with beautiful elegance. It gives your website/product/service that personal touch the internet misses via conversational UI 
-Hugo (https://hugo.events/product): which is a fanbase management solution (think of it as a combination of SurveyMonkeys and Mailchimps). It accumulates your people data and allows you to enrich it, segment it and easily send out email campaigns.

## Company size
5-10 people 

## Region
Worldwide - We support working remote but we are very open (and support it even more) if you want to come and work in the Netherlands (it's a great country ;) )!
