# Formstack

## Company blurb

Formstack's birthday is February 28, 2006. We started as one guy trying to provide a simple data capture solution. Since then, our product has evolved into a robust platform that helps users of all industries better engage with their customers and manage data. Formstack is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, but our 500,000+ users live and work all over the world.

## Company size

60 staff and growing!

## Remote status

Formstack is a remote company, with employees in several states and countries. While, yes, this means 'stackers can work at home in their PJs, it also means we've developed a unique culture that thrives on transparency, communication, and fun. We know how to work hard and play hard from wherever we feel most productive - whether that's on a living room couch, in the Formstack office, or on a beach in Thailand.
