# NoRedInk

## Company blurb

I'm Jeff Scheur, and I created NoRedInk while teaching high school English in Chicago. Like so many educators, I graded well over 15,000 papers, wondering how I could develop more efficient systems to help my students quickly address their misconceptions. It's no secret that learners need immediate feedback, curriculum that stems from their interests, and lots of practice in order to show rapid growth, and yet teachers can only do so much with large classes and limited time.

I created NoRedInk to help my students improve their skills with engaging material â€” and to allow me to track their progress over time. It also freed me up to focus on big-picture concepts in student writing that sorely needed my attention. Now supported by a team of expert teachers, engineers, and language experts, NoRedInk's mission is to help all students harness the power of language. I hope the site is useful to you, your colleagues, and your students.
