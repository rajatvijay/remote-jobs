## Company size

30+

## Remote status

Most work is done remotely, a handful of people come in to the office a few days a week from around the bay area. Most of engineering travels to clients ~25%.

This means a vast majority of the company is remote at any one point in time. Remote work isn't integrated, it is the backbone of the company.

## Region

Customers are mostly based in the US.

## Company technologies

If there's a tool common in solving DevOps problems, we've probably got someone proficient in it. Our most common tool of choice however is Chef.

## Office locations

Main office in downtown San Francisco
