# Casumo

## Company blurb

Casumo is a technology startup founded on the premise and belief that technology not only drives innovation in products but also disrupts markets and industries. In a commoditised market, differentiation and innovation are paramount.

We are dedicated to change the world of igaming forever and we are founded upon a single promise: to deliver the world’s best gaming experience. No, it’s not just a bullet in our brand book, it’s a promise. We believe that owning our own technology plays a key part in reaching that goal.

Casumo as a product is a recognized, award winning online casino. We’re not working with casino, we’re working with challenging and changing the common perception of what casino is. Through design, technology & innovation we aim to disrupt a young, and in many ways immature industry, by ignoring the rules.

We structure our company on the promise of freedom and responsibility. We hire great people and get out of their way. We work to remove obstacles, to provide framework and to lead by providing context.
