## Company blurb

iwantmyname is a pure domain management service offering domain registration and DNS hosting.
We believe that any person, organisation or company should have complete control over their web address. You should be able to own it, use it the way you want and move it if necessary. This can all be achieved by registering a domain name.

Until now, the process of buying and managing domains has been far too difficult, confusing and non-transparent. Consequently, we have set out to create a much better experience for domain seekers in order to make it simple to find, register and set up domains.
