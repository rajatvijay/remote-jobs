# CrowdTangle

## Company blurb

We do social media content discovery, which means keeping track of millions of posts each day and allowing our clients to easily find the ones they care about. Clients see which posts are doing the best, who is posting to their site, where they rank among peers, etc. See client list, press, more details at [crowdtangle.com](http://crowdtangle.com).

## Company size

15-30

## Remote status

Our team is fully remote. Our co-founders live on opposite coasts and have since the beginning, so the company was built with the assumption of being remote. We do have a cluster of people in some places, like New York, but the culture is around being anywhere. For example, our end-of-year celebration was held on Hangouts.

## Region

For technical hires, we're looking anywhere in the United States. For non-technical hires, there may be other considerations, like needing reps in particular cities or countries.

## Company technologies

- Java
- React
- PHP
- MySQL
- DynamoDB
- ElasticSearch

## Office locations

Offices arise when there is a critical mass in one city. So far, that's just New York.
