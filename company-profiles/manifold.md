# Manifold

## Company blurb

We’re an ambitious and well-funded startup, making it compelling for developers to break their deployments free from the closed ecosystems of cloud providers. We connect applications, wherever they are hosted, to independent cloud services made by developers who care.

Our partially distributed team is fun-loving, knowledgeable, and extremely productive. We’re organized to let you explore and grow a variety of skills and capabilities, with many opportunities to make a significant impact. Many of us have strong ties to the open-source world, and have experience building tools at companies like Heroku, Salesforce, Red Hat, and Canonical.
