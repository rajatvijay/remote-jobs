# Sensu, Inc.

## Company blurb

Sensu enables high-velocity organizations to maintain operational visibility, while supporting software and infrastructure-as-code development best practices, and solving the unique challenges of monitoring in dynamic operating environments (e.g. public/private/hybrid cloud computing environments, container-based environments, and more). At Sensu we are on a mission to obviate the need to (re)build custom monitoring solutions. We believe that completely open source monitoring solutions will empower companies to deliver value to their customers faster, at a larger scale, and with full confidence that comes from deep visibility into the health of their infrastructure, applications, and business. It is our goal to enable human beings to enjoy a healthier life/work balance by providing them with better monitoring solutions. You may be a good fit to join our team if these ideas resonate with you.
