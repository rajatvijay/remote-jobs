## Remote status
We employ several strategies that ensure inclusive and collaborative environment for all employees. To communicate we use Slack (text-chat), our own [Talky](https://talky.io) (video chat and meetings), [Ginger](https://gingerhq.com) (daily check-ins) and Github (organisation wide discussions). One-on-ones and bi-weekly company-wide updates are crucial part of not only staying connected but also understanding process, structure as well as employees' wellbeing. Furthermore, at least once per year we organize an all-hands team week.
