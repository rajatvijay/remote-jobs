## Company blurb

**Fixing & updating existing code is our speciality**
Every member of the Corgibytes team is a consummate problem solver. We love tinkering, testing, and turning frustration into relief. Some call us craftsman. Others, code whisperers. We just have a knack for identifying problems and building solutions. Spaghetti code? We love it. Or, at least making it better.

**Our mission**
To maintain and improve the world's existing code.

**Our vision**
Codebases are nurtured to provide the highest value for the longest time.

**Core values**

*Adopt a Growth Mindset*
Constantly find ways to expand your knowledge and learn new things. Your intelligence and talent is not fixed, it’s developed over time through perseverance, dedication and hard work.

*Calm the Chaos*
Urgency leads to errors; frenzy to frustration. Focus on developing the steady working rhythm and calm mind that works best for solving complex problems.

*Communication Is Just as Important as Code*
No one at Corgibytes identifies as a “technical” or “non-technical” because everyone is both. Practice both types of skills regularly.

*Think of Others*
Coding doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Consider the other people who are impacted by your work: your clients, your users, your teammates, and even your future self.

*Craftsmanship in Context*
Match your solution to the situation. Sometimes, it’s a quick and dirty prototype to prove a concept. When the stakes are high, spending extra time getting it right is the best way to go.
