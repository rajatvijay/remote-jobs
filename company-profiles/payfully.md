# Payfully

## Company blurb

Payfully is a financial services platform for the peer-to-peer rental market that lets property managers improve their cash flow. Our platform uses state-of-the-art technology and invoice factoring to help property managers using Airbnb, HomeAway, Booking.com, and Flipkey to receive the payment for their upcoming reservations within 24 hours, instead of at guest check-in.

We are a team of experts in technology, finance, sales and customer service, solving some very complex problems in the alternative lending space; we are looking for A-Players who want to help us build this multi-billion dollar company from the early days.

If you are passionate about your craft and would like to work in a friendly environment (where you will face challenges on a daily basis) then drop us a line, we'd love to hear from you.
