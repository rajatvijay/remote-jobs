# InQuicker

## Company blurb
We exist to improve access to health care. We are committed to providing the best
possible experience for patients to register their health care appointments. Digital self-scheduling and
discharge-scheduling is our specialty, and we provide increased patient retention, satisfaction and engagement
to our customers.

## Company size
~ 50 out of several thousand across our parent company, Stericycle.

## Remote status
The dev team is completely remote, always has been. Our awesome product managers are based in Nashville, with
the rest of the company, but that has never negatively affected the dev team. If anything, it's made getting
together in-person all the more special. We do one big annual retreat (Panama, Tofino, Santa Cruz) and we have
several smaller meetups as needed.

We use Slack, [Appear.in](https://appear.in), Trello, and other fantastic remote-friendly tools. Github,
Circle CI, other fun services too.
