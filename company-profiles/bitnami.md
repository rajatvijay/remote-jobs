# Bitnami

## Company blurb

Build the software packaging and delivery tools that impact millions of people. 

We make server software easier to use, regardless of platform â€” in a VM, the cloud, or a container. Try one of the 140+ applications and development runtimes we package and learn what makes Bitnami awesome. We also produce an end-to-end automation platform used to create, secure, publish and update software stacks for all the major container and cloud platforms, from a single Docker image to a scalable Cloud Formation template.

We are bootstrapped, profitable and growing. Bitnami was also part of Y Combinator's Winter 2013 batch. You can find more about Bitnami in our [About Us page](https://bitnami.com/about-us).
