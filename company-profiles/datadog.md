## Company blurb

Cloud-Scale Monitoring - Monitoring that tracks your dynamic infrastructure and applications.

Do you want to make a difference? Are you exceptional at your job, and intrinsically motivated by it? Do you eat hard problems for breakfast and find them beautifully simple solutions by lunchtime? Do you ever wish you were there in the early days of these startups everyone is talking about?
