# Chargify

## Company blurb

We've been around for 6 years, supporting almost every kind of organization that needs to bill people over and over: online software businesses, churches, schools, storage unit owners, shippers of recurring packages, and many others.
And over that time, with that variety of merchants using Chargify, we've developed our software to support just about every common business model and pricing model. Chargify is a recurring billing system designed for Web 2.0 and SaaS companies. Chargify frees you from worrying about billing so you can focus on building innovative web applications.
