## Company blurb

We make modern software for modern buildings.

Currently half the world lives in a city; soon 70% will. Buildings use 40% of the world’s electricity. In the U.S. alone, the value of commercial real estate tops a trillion dollars. And much of this asset class is still run with spreadsheets, clipboards, and outdated software.

Meanwhile, property managers and facility engineers are being asked to do more with less. Mobile workforces, climbing energy costs, complex IT needs, and rising tenant expectations are forcing operational staff to find better ways to work.

Gridium crafts beautiful, easy-to-use tools for the way buildings work now: mobile, always-on, and data-driven. Whether you are managing energy use, coordinating vendors, or communicating with tenants, your software should make your job simpler, not more complex.

## Company size

19 so far.

## Remote status

We're entirely remote, including our founders - one lives in the Bay area, the other in Chicago. We use best-in-class tools to make this not only possible, but great.

We also know that face-time and bonding are important, so we have Camp every 3 months. We fly everyone to an interesting place for three days of meetings, food, and adventures. There's more at [our careers page](http://gridium.com/about/working-at-gridium/).

## Region

About a third of us are in the Bay area, but we have several other US locales represented, including Los Angeles, Portland, Milwaukee, Miami, and Las Vegas.
